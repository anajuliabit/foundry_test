## Foundry test

Project created to test [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) framework 

I have copied [AccessController.sol](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/boson-protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/access/AccessController.sol) from Boson contracts to rewrite the [unit tests](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/boson-protocol-contracts/blob/main/test/access/AccessControllerTest.js) with forge test tools 

Run tests: ```forge test```
